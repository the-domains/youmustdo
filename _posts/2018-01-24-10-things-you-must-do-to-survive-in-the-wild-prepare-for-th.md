# 10 things you must do to survive in the wild, prepare for the worst.

Back to the stone age? WW3 just came? EMP or Nuclear bomb just cut all electrics! Pack your backpack and do those things you must do.

## 1\. Pack your **INVENTORY**

Prevention is the best remedy no? Make a list of your **smallest** and **lightest** favourite items you can store in a back pack specially made for emergency to be ready to go in less a minute. Keep everything you've got, these items will become your most best possessions and could save your life. You will need the best trek **[backpack][0]**:

## 2\. You need **TOOLS**

Keep a pocket knife, or multi-tool with you at all times, because you never know when you will need it- and when you do need it, you will rejoice that you have something to cut, protect and prepare food- even if all you have is a crappy, little knife.

## 3\. Build a **SHELTER**

You must familiarize yourself with how to build a shelter.****But first **prepare **yourself now don't wait the last minute. You need to find a site close (but not too close) to water, wood, and other resources. Search the site near you **now,** because if you wait until a calamity like an EMP you will lose time searching your site! There are various types of shelters you can build. Overhead covering for warmth at night and protection from the elements. If you are in rocky, mountainous terrain, look for overhangs. Otherwise, use limbs and leaves or anything that can provide insulation. Pine needles usually blanket the ground in thick batches, excellent for bedding. If you'r not an handily guy, buy an **[emergency tent ][1]**that you can put in your backpack.

**AGUA POR FAVOR**Your body will not last more than three days without water. If you are lucky enough to be near a body of freshwater -- good for you, just make sure to boil before quenching your thirst. No water in sight? Continue your search and construct a rain catcher or water still.

**KEEP THAT BELLY HAPPY**Things can get frustrating when it comes to finding adequate sources of food when you are in survival mode, especially since malnutrition will work you mentally and physically, making you feel weak, cranky and delirious. It's a good idea to get familiar with edible wild berries and plants for future reference when out in the wild. Also, it's time to grow up and banish the word "picky" from your vocabulary. When it comes to survival, embrace anything and everything (carefully) including bugs, eggs, fruit, leaves. Learn to build some simple traps to catch small animals and don't rely on just one single food source. Protein is important for strength; know what various nutrients your body needs for prime sustainability.

**LIGHT THAT FIRE**Those glowing red flames provide light, cooked food, warmth and protection from predators and pesky bugs. Here are a few tried and true techniques for conjuring that mighty blaze:

* [Fire Plow][2]
* [Bow and Drill][3]
* [Lens Method][4]
* [Fire from Ice][5]
* [Soda Can and Chocolate][6]
* [Battery method][7]

**NAVIGATION**It's a good idea to have a [compass][8] with you at all times, but if not then what? Get old school and [use the stars][9]-- it's a lot easier than you think. Also, keep note of rivers, paths or mountains- following these can lead to roads and civilization.
