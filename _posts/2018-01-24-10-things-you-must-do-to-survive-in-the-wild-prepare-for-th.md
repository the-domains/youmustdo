# 10 things you must do to survive in the wild, prepare for the worst.

Back to the stone age? WW3 just came? EMP or Nuclear bomb just cut all electrics! Pack your backpack and do those things you must do.

## 1\. Pack your **INVENTORY**

Prevention is the best remedy no? Make a list of your **smallest** and **lightest** favourite items you can store in a back pack specially made for emergency to be ready to go in less a minute. Keep everything you've got, these items will become your most best possessions and could save your life. You will need the best trek **[backpack][0]**:

## 2\. You need **TOOLS**

You need light and small tool. Need a pocket knife or multi-tool with you at all times, because you never know when you will need it. I suggest the **best [multi camp survivor tool][1]** you must have:

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/09b0b1d069128fe4d021fe314f23e5202aeb4e7a.jpg" /><h1>Military Tactical Multi function Shovel Camping Survival Folding Knife Saw Pelle </h1><p>Total Length: approximate 74cm / Length of Handle: 57.5cm / Length of Shovel: 16.5cm / Width of Shovel: 13.0cm.

## 3\. Build a **SHELTER**

You must familiarize yourself with how to build a shelter.But first **prepare **yourself now don't wait the last minute. You need to find a site close (but not too close) to water, wood, and other resources. Search the site near you **now,** because if you wait until a calamity like an EMP you will lose time searching your site! There are various types of shelters you can build. Overhead covering for warmth at night and protection from the elements. If you are in rocky, mountainous terrain, look for overhangs. Otherwise, use limbs and leaves or anything that can provide insulation. Pine needles usually blanket the ground in thick batches, excellent for bedding. If you'r not an handily guy, buy an **[emergency tent ][2]**that you can put in your backpack.

## 4\. You will need **WATER**

Your body will not last more than 3 days without water. If you can't boil your water found in a lake you can use pills or **[portable pump filter][3]**. You don't find water? Learn how to catch water from rain or if you have access to sea you can desalinate it. So knowing how to replenish your water stocks is essential :

* Trap Rainwater
* Collect dew
* Take to the trees
* Dig a well
* Defrost ice and snow
* Desalinate water sea

## 5\. You will need**FIRE**

Fire provide light, cooked food, warmth and protection from predators and bugs. If you are out of matches here are some techniques found on the web:

* Fire Plow
* Bow and Drill
* Lens Method
* Fire from Ice
* Soda Can and Chocolate
* Battery method
* Magnesium Striker Lighter

I recommend to buy this cheap easy to carry lighter flint:

Material: Flint stone, magnesium stone, scraper (iron). | eBay!</p></article>

## 6\. You will need **FOOD**

In a survival situation, you have to take advantage of everything available to eat. Most wilderness areas are full of natural food, ranging from plants to insects. The food sources you can exploit are determined by the habitat you are in. Meat and fish are good sources of protein and fat and provide virtually everything a long-term survivor would need. However, at the first stage of a survival situation, plants are the most appropriate diet as plants are easily accessible and contain the necessary carbohydrates. Cooking is a skill of great importance for all wilderness travellers. Cooking not only makes many foods more appetizing to taste, but also ensure that parasites and bacteria are killed. You don't want to get sick from food poisoning. A compact camping stove is very convenient in the wilderness. However, in many situations, a cooking fire is more practical and allows a wider variety of cooking opportunities. As a survival skill, you should also be able to prepare your food without any cooking utensils.

* **Wild edible plants **Depending of the time of the year you will almost always find edible plants, unless you are in the middle of an arid desert. Knowledge of only one or two wild edible plants can be of great help in your search for survival food.

* **Edible insects **Your most vital nutritional needs in a survival situation are protein and fat. Most insects are rich in both. So close your eyes and eat.

* **Fishing**

* **Trapping **Unless you are an experienced hunter, hunting animals for meat is inadvisable in a survival situation. Hunting is difficult and you will expend a lot of energy to get your food. Instead of hunting consider trapping. Trapping requires less skill and leaves you free to spend time searching for other food sources. The wilderness survivor needs simple traps that are easy to remember and easy to construct.

* **Bird eggs **Eggs offer high nutritional value, are convenient and safe. They can be boiled, baked or fried. The first obvious place to look for them is a bird nest. However, not all birds build a nest, but instead lay their eggs directly on the ground or in a hole.

## 7\. NAVIGATION

If you don't have a **[compass][4]**, get old school and use the stars and the sun with shadow it's a lot easier than you think. Also, keep note of rivers, paths or mountains following these can lead to roads and civilization.

## 8\. Material to keep **WARM**

Depending on where you are in wild, staying warm could be very difficult, but it is essential for survival. Making sure you have **[insulating clothing][5]** with you.

<article style=""><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6198c06d08db4087931fd5f1d5068c6a0cf72a6c.jpg" /><h1>Coghlans Emergency Thermal Sleeping Bag Mylar Bivvy Sack Survival Shelter </h1><p>Can also be used to construct an emergency shelter. Also makes a great ground cloth for your tent. This bag is designed to keep the elements out and your body heat in, and is a critical part of any emergency preparedness kit. | eBay!</p></article>

## 9\. Natural insect repellent

Insects can be not only annoying as you are focusing on trying to survive, they could be decreasing your chances of survival due to spread of bacterial and parasitic diseases. Thus, having a natural insect repellent will be beneficial. Did you know something as simple as lemon juice could repel mosquitoes?

## 10\. **[Self-Aid][6]**

If you injure yourself out on your own in a wilderness environment, you will be vulnerable to infection and illness. Learn how to create an all-natural first **[aid kit][6]**.

The life saving steps are those steps taken to stabilize a victim until medical assistance can be obtained. They include:

* (1) Clearing the airway.
* (2) Restoring the breathing.
* (3) Restoring the heartbeat
* (4) Controlling the bleeding.
* (5) Protecting the wound.
* (6) Treat/prevent shock.

For example burns are very painful and can cause scarring or death. Expose the burned area without pulling clothing over the burn or removing clothing stuck to the burn. Apply a loose, dry sterile dressing over the burn. Do not apply ointment or grease. Do not break blisters. Treat for shock. Prevent infection. Give small amounts of water if not nauseated and no neck or abdominal wound is evident. Give aspirin to relieve the pain. For serious burns, treat for shock and evacuate if possible.
