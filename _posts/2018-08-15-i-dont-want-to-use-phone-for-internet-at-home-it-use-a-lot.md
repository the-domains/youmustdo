  I don't want to use phone for internet at home. It use a lot of $ data $
  unless you have wifi. Another thing is to always transferring photos from
  phone to pc via wireless connection or cable. It take more time and use
  batteries etc... So was wondering how can i use Instagram to download pictures
  in my pc or laptop without the phone. Instagram was made for phones app so the
  pc website only allowed you to download video. I thought about Bluestacks but
  it take a lot of RAM its heavy on my pc and long to open. I found for you very
  easily to download pictures from Instagram in pc with chrome!. Bluestacks is a
  program to use phone app on your pc mostly for games. So if you want to try
  that there's the link: http://bstk.me/qNRYyuCcg You need bluestacks if you
  want to link your Facebook with Instagram cause i couldn't find a way with the
  chrome browser.
