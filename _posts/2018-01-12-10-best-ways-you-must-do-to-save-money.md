# _**10 Best ways you must do to save money**_

## 1\. Buy only the thing you **really** need.

Why do you need a car if you can walk or ride a bicycle. If you really need a car why you buy a big pick-up instead of small economic car. Cars are painful waste of money.

You need to pay:

* The price of the car (specially if its new = more taxes)
* Insurances + licences plates
* Fuel
* Repairs & periodic maintenance...

I can tell you some years ago during my college time i bought a 10 years old used car 2000$ cash. It was my first car not the best look but mechanic A1\. I used it during 2 years without any extra big repairs only normal repairs like brakes, tires, oil etc. You know what? I even sold it at 400$! So it cost me only 1600$ for a normal used car during 2 years!

Another example electronics devices! Do you need all of theses to go on internet? Pc, laptop, tablet, smartphone, smart watch. Can you choose 1 or 2 pcs max.? Also now the big brands used to change models every year! You can stick on 1 used model for 2-3 years?

Tips when you want to buy:

* **Be patient and not impulsive**. When you see in a store a thing you like a lot don't buy it now just wait some days. Maybe you will find cheaper other places.
* Instead of buying brands name buy generic items.
* Shop online, now online store like **[eBay][0]** and **[Amazon][1]** have a lot of cheaper stuff with free shipping. You can also try to win an auction on **[eBay][0]**.
* Find good used stuff instead of new. You save on price and taxes.
* Look for quality/price and quantity/price. For example if you buy a brand cable for 20$ but you can buy **[2 generic cable for 10$][2]**. The brand cable lasted 6 months and the generics lasted 3 months each. So you save 10$ for 6 months!

## 2\. **DON'T** take loan

Get rid of your credit card now. If you don't have the money don't buy. But if you have emergency ask family or friends, give them a present when you repaying debts. Buy with cash or with prepaid card. There's good prepaid card with low fees like **[Payoneer][3] .**

## 3\. **[Stop][4]** smoking & all bad habit like alcohol drugs

Stopping smoking can save you a lot $$$ each month. Also its good for your health. Same thing for alcohol and drugs. Putting money into a product or action that does not produce any financial, or otherwise, beneficial results. There is no return on your investment. A pack of cigarettes range anywhere from 5$ to 12$ per pack. If you smoke approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day, you can potentially save over 2200$ per year! (Its more then the price of my car i used 2 years in point 1 hehe). You can **[buy some patches][5]** to help quit.

## 4\. [Pack your][6]**[lunch][6]**

At approximate **$4 **for **[lunch][6]**, that's a 60% savings over eating out. If you save **$6 **a day X 5 days a week = $30 a week, **$120 **a month, and almost **$1,500 **a year.

## 5\. [Stop buying in ][7]**[vending machine][7]**

Coffee there, chips there or soft drink there... Bad habit can lead you to spend. If you don't do step \#4 it can grow fast. If you spend 5$ per week in machines its around 25$ per month.

## 6\. Do **FREE** sports & activities

I'm sure you know somebody that have a fitness club membership or a machine workout at home. Most of the time the machine finish in the wardrobe with dust on it. You can search and find free activities near you. Go take a walk or do jogging in a national park. Also there's a lot of workout tricks you can find and do yourself with object around you.

I'm sure you didn't visit all what's around you in your own city or country! There's some tip for travelling:

* closer you go from home, less you spend
* you can **[camp ][8]**instead of stay in an hotel room
* rent / exchange your apartment / house during your trip
* travel with family or friends to share fees

## 8\. SIDE JOBS

Everyone has a skill that they can earn extra money. If you do 1 side job, even 1 time a week you'll see a quick increase in your savings. Some ideas:

* taking a part-time seasonal job
* cutting grass or doing yard work
* cleaning homes
* babysitting, animal-sitting
* running errands for people in your community
* driving with a service like Uber
* offering consulting services
* selling on **[eBay][9]** or **[amazon][10]**
* do garages sells
* do some surveys

## 9\. Live in your parents home

Why you want to go on a rent? Instead you can rest in your parents home? Or if you can't try to share a rent apartment with friend. Think about it, a rent its around half of your pay check.

## 10\. Use energy star bulb and home appliance

ENERGY STAR certified bulbs:

* Use about 70-90% less energy and produce about 70% less heat than traditional incandescent bulbs
* Save $30-80 per bulb
* Last about 10 to 25 times longer
