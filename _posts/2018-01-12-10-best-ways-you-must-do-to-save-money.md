# _**10 Best ways you must do to save money**_

## 1\. Buy only the thing you **really** need.

Why do you need a car if you can walk or ride a bicycle. If you really need a car why you buy a big pick-up instead of small economic car. Cars are painful waste of money.

You need to pay:

* The price of the car (specially if its new = more taxes)
* Insurances + licences plates
* Fuel
* Repairs & periodic maintenance...

I can tell you some years ago during my college time i bought a 10 years old used car 2000$ cash. It was my first car not the best look but mechanic A1\. I used it during 2 years without any extra big repairs only normal repairs like brakes, tires, oil etc. You know what? I even sold it at 400$! So it cost me only 1600$ for a normal used car during 2 years!

Another example electronics devices! Do you need all of theses to go on internet? Pc, laptop, tablet, smartphone, smart watch. Can you choose 1 or 2 pcs max.? Also now the big brands used to change models every year! You can stick on 1 used model for 2-3 years?

Tips when you want to buy:

* **Be patient and not impulsive**. When you see in a store a thing you like a lot don't buy it now just wait some days. Maybe you will find cheaper other places.
* Instead of buying brands name buy generic items.
* Shop online, now online store like **[eBay][0]** and **[Amazon][1]** have a lot of cheaper stuff with free shipping. You can also try to win an auction on **[eBay][0]**.
* Find good used stuff instead of new. You save on price and taxes.
* Look for quality/price and quantity/price. For example if you buy a brand cable for 20$ but you can buy **[2 generic cable for 10$][2]**. The brand cable lasted 6 months and the generics lasted 3 months each. So you save 10$ for 6 months!

## 2\. **DON'T** take loan

Get rid of your credit card now. If you don't have the money don't buy. But if you have emergency ask family or friends, give them a present when you repaying debts. Buy with cash or with prepaid card. There's good prepaid card with low fees like **[Payoneer][3] .**

## 3\. Stop smoking & all bad habit like alcohol drugs

Stopping smoking can save you a lot $$$ each month. Also its good for your health. Same thing for alcohol and drugs. Putting money into a product or action that does not produce any financial, or otherwise, beneficial results. There is no return on your investment. A pack of cigarettes range anywhere from 5$ to 12$ per pack. If you smoke approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day, you can potentially save over 2200$ per year! (Its more then the price of my car i used 2 years in point 1 hehe). You can **[buy some patches][4]** to help quit.
