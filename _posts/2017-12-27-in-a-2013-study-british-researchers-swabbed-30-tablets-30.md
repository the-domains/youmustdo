  In a 2013 study, researchers swabbed 30 tablets, 30 phones and an office
  toilet seat. The tablets had up to 600 units per swab of staphylococcus, and
  the phones had up to 140 units. The toilet seat (you think its the niche of
  bacteria) had less than 20 units. Another uncomfortable detail: In a 2011
  survey, 75 percent of Americans said they use their smartphones while on the
  toilet.

# _**15 things you must clean but almost never do.**_

## \#1.Phones and tablets

In a 2013 study, researchers swabbed 30 tablets, 30 phones and an office toilet seat. The tablets had up to 600 units per swab of staphylococcus, and the phones had up to 140 units. The toilet seat (you think its the niche of bacteria) had less than 20 units. Another uncomfortable detail: In a 2011 survey, 75 percent of Americans said they use their smartphones while on the toilet.
