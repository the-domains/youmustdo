  In a 2013 study, researchers swabbed 30 tablets, 30 phones and an office
  toilet seat. The tablets had up to 600 units per swab of staphylococcus, and
  the phones had up to 140 units. The toilet seat (you think its the niche of
  bacteria) had less than 20 units. Another uncomfortable detail: In a 2011
  survey, 75 percent of Americans said they use their smartphones while on the
  toilet. What you gonna do when you will buy and received your next used
  smartphone?

# _**15 things you must clean but almost never do.**_

## \#1\.[Phones and tablets][0]

In a 2013 study, researchers swabbed 30 tablets, 30 phones and an office toilet seat. The tablets had up to 600 units per swab of staphylococcus, and the phones had up to 140 units. The toilet seat (you think its the niche of bacteria) had less than 20 units.

## \#2\. [The belt][2]

Hey! what the first thing you touch after the pee and poo? Always _**BEFORE**_ washing your hands. Think, when did you clean your belt?

## \#3\. [Rack & magazines][3] (in toilet and waiting room)

That's disgusting... Please check the _**DATE **_of the **magazines** in the rack on the side of your toilet bowl or on the table at your dentist waiting room.

Did you know? Your toilet has a splash zone, and anything in the radius will probably get contaminated with pee/poo matter. In fact, flushing the toilet can send particles splashing and floating **as far as 6 feet away**, according to the Harvard School of Public Health. Tip: Limit the risk by closing the cover before flushing. A study in the UK found that there were 12 times more germs around toilets bowl then on the seat. Why? Mostly because everybody clean the seat more often then all stuff around.

## \#5\. [Grocery Carts][5]

Placing children in grocery carts has been implicated recently as a source of infection with **salmonella **and **campylobacter **in young children. This study was conducted to assess the occurrence total bacteria, **coli-form bacteria **and **escherichia coli **on grocery shopping cart handles and seats. Research said there's _**fecal bacteria **_on **72%** of shopping Carts.

## \#6\. [Shoes & slippers][7]

You think its only your bottom shoes? REMEMBER rule at the point \#3 :

> ...pushing the flush toilet handle can send particles splashing and floating as far as 6 feet away.

So please specially for the man, if you can **SIT** on the bowl when you go to toilet. Imagine the 6 feet splash every time you pee it can goes on the top of your shoes. You don't wash your shoes or slippers every week...watch out. Kelly Reynolds, Ph.D., a microbiologist says: 'We walk through things like bird droppings, dog waste and germs on public **restroom floors**, all of which are sources for E coli,'. Researchers discovered that the transfer of bacteria from shoes to home floors ranged from 90% to 99%. Tip: keep your shoes out of the house or in a **[shoes rack][8]**[.][8] You can buy a quick **[shoe cleaner here][9]**.

## \#7 [Your tongue][10]

I'm sorry for the picture but if you need to clean your tongue do it every-time as you brush your teeth. The microbes living on the tongue have been referred to as "bad breath factories." A recent study published by the American Dental Association confirmed people whose tongues contain large colonies of anaerobic bacteria more often have stronger smelling breath than those whose tongues are clean. You can find **[tongue scraper cleaner here.][10]**

## \#9 **[Bank cards & money][12]**

A small new study from England reveals that as many as **[1 in 10 bank cards][12]** have fecal bacteria on them. And one in seven bills 14% are contaminated with the bacteria.

"People may tell us they wash their hands but the research shows us different, and highlights just how easily transferable these pathogens are surviving on our money and cards," study researcher Dr. Ron Cutler, of Queen Mary, University of London, said in a statement.
